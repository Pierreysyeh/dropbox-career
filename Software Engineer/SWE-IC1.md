My primary craft focus is on learning the fundamentals of reading and writing code within a large, long-lived codebase, gaining familiarity with the technologies in my area of work, and learning to work against plans and schedules.

| **Responsibility** | **Key Behaviors** |
| **Code Fluency** | * I translate ideas into clear code, written to be read as well as executed<br><br>* My code is free of glaring errors - bugs are in edge cases or design, not mainline paths - and is well documented and well tested with appropriate use of manual vs automated tests<br><br>* I’m capable of reading and navigating functions and classes/modules that I didn’t write<br><br>* I am learning to tackle coding tasks with high throughput while maintaining appropriately high quality; I optimize for either speed or quality, depending on the explicitly stated needs of my team |
