------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like Staff Engineers, I have a well-rounded set of technical skills and development methodologies, and apply them with a sophisticated approach that is best suited for each project. I design systems that are far from my previous experience, anticipating scale and scope beyond the current requirements at Dropbox or in areas otherwise unexplored. I make or participate in discussions around making sweeping technical choices that lack clearly correct answers, but am able to articulate the rationale and technical vision behind those choices. I  partner with cross-functional stakeholders to identify major new business opportunities unlocked by technical capabilities.

| **Responsibility** | **Key Behaviors** |
| **Code fluency** | * The expectations for code fluency do not go up beyond L3  (though some specialist engineers may go deep in this area) |
| **Software design** | * The expectations for software design do not go up beyond L5. |
| **Architecture Design** | * I can design systems that require research on what is possible rather than relying on my past experience, and where, consequently, a significant portion of the challenge is designing an appropriately staged validation plan.<br><br>* I define the high level systems we need to build to meet strategic objectives |
| **Technical Strategy** | * I am responsible for making technical choices that have no one clearly correct answer but whose consequences have a sweeping effect across my scope in the organization<br><br>* I rally my organization around those choices by providing a clear rationale and technical vision backing them |
