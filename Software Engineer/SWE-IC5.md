| **Impact** | * I identify and execute on opportunities that have area/group-wide impact <br><br>* I execute large projects to a very high standard — e.g. against a tight deadline with significant consequences of failure, or in a manner that allows rapid learning to clarify significant ambiguity, or to a standard of quality well exceeding that of the current system  (though not all simultaneously)<br><br>* I know which levers to pull to drive meaningful results and understand the wider, cross-functional implications of my work. I proactively account for risks and monitor their likelihood. My project planning accounts for new capabilities necessary to deliver large-scale business impact and I work closely with partner teams to prioritize the development of these capabilities.<br><br>* I proactively identify and help to refocus my team's efforts when projects are off-course or not technically feasible and results aren’t moving the needle for our business/team goals or serving the needs of customers in a meaningful way |
| **Ownership** | * I have a sense of responsibility and obligation to act on opportunities I see across the engineering org/company |
| **Decision Making** | * I have a holistic view of the engineering org and Dropbox’s goals and use  my experience and judgment to make decisions optimized for the wider org, rather than my local project alone<br><br>* I act thoughtfully and decisively in critical situations even when making challenging or unpopular decisions<br><br>* I'm able to reach the right  decision despite conflicting perspectives |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a well-rounded set of technical skills and apply them with a sophisticated approach that is best suited for each project. I am a master of designing simple, flexible software components, enforce the quality of my team’s designs and provide quality feedback on designs of related areas. I ensure my team’s work fits with the broader technical strategy of the organization. I am called to design software or systems in the face of significant ambiguity or a large number of dependencies, and my designs do not anticipate the maintainers to have my expertise. I work with cross-functional partners to discover novel technical solutions to business problems.

| **Responsibility** | **Key Behaviors** |
| **Code fluency** | * The expectations for code fluency do not go beyond L3  (though some specialist engineers may go deep in this area) |
| **Software design** | * I design software components that are difficult to misuse and flexible in the face of an increase in the number of adjacent use cases as appropriate to the direction of the business  (neither under nor over-designed)<br><br>* I reduce complex designs and concepts to simple foundational components through correct choices of data structures, applications of algorithms, or other deep insight into the problem space  (ex:  3 tree model in sync engine) and create simple interfaces to complex underlying systems<br><br>* I’m able to review designs in related areas with high quality and ensure quality for cross-team cross-module design/API issues<br><br>* I may have deep expertise in implementation or principles behind some of the libraries, platforms and systems relevant to my team's work |
| **Architecture Design** | * I make correct technology choices for components needed as part of a larger architecture, including making build vs buy choices for specific components, and choosing frameworks<br><br>* I’m capable of owning the overall health and engineering quality of a system or collection of features - e.g. driving regular health reviews, curating test strategy, etc - and ensuring that the health and maintenance of my systems do not depend on the maintainers having my expertise<br><br>* I’m capable of driving overall testing strategy of a significant system with high reliability or quality requirements  (e.g. building validation systems or new test frameworks to do so)<br><br>* I’m capable of designing systems with significant ambiguity and/or lots of systems that depend on it |
| **Technical Strategy** | * I’m accountable for alignment of the software and systems in my area to overall technical strategy, making tradeoffs where appropriate in consultation with principal engineers |
