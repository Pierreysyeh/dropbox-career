------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am expected to independently drive multi-phase programs, often requiring cross-team communication and coordination. I build well-designed sub-components of programs within the framework of multi-phase program’s goals and requirements. I  own some of a program’s quarterly goals and am responsible for delivering these goals on time with a high standard of quality. In addition to being a highly productive individual, I am expected to provide substantial mentorship to less experienced colleagues, and often lead the Program direction.
