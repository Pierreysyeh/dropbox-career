-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have achieved a broad mastery of my craft, and typically have developed a specific expertise of some kind that enables me to increase my leverage. I apply my mastery and leadership to own and deliver programs that are often risky, require novel solutions, and span EPD and functions, while continuing to do my fair share of the hands-on work required for programs to succeed. My expertise often spans multiple domains or functions and I am highly leveraged in the organization. I am versatile, and am able to apply my technical and problem solving skills to diverse problems.
