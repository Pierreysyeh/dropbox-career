------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an entry-level for TPM at Dropbox, I work as part of a team, with teammates, a manager, and more senior TPMs. I am primarily expected to focus on delivering results as an individual, improving my craft as a TPM, and upholding Dropbox’s culture and values. I am expected to create leverage for myself via a technical skillset and not purely from process.
