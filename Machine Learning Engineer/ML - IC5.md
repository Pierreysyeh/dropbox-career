-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I ensure the quality of ML systems for my team and ensure the validity of experimentation strategy and offline and online metrics for my team. I am an expert in ML modeling, techniques and toolkits and adapt my team’s work based on latest developments in these fields. I propose new business initiatives powered by ML for Dropbox.

I have a well-rounded set of system design and architecture skills that allow me to design ML systems that interface effectively with infra and frontend systems that are adjacent.

| --- | --- |
| **Responsibility** | **Key Behaviors** |
| **ML Fluency** | * I am an expert in a range of ML technique  (e.g.,  deep learning, optimization, regression, ensembles, tree based methods, dimensionality reduction, Bayesian modeling, etc.), area  (CV, NLP, RL, etc.),  or tool  (sklearn, pytorch, tensorflow, etc.) and I select such solutions that work long-term for my team.<br><br>* I track the state of art ML developments in areas related to my team’s work and when beneficial, I incorporate those results into my team’s work.<br><br>* I am capable of owning the overall strategy for ensuring the quality of ML systems my team builds. My analysis goes beyond standard metrics, incorporating concerns such as privacy, bias, security and maintainability.<br><br>* My modeling strategy correctly balances theoretical soundness against engineering practicality; off-the-shelf solutions against in-house solutions; and timely delivery of capabilities against extensibility. |
| **ML Design** | * I propose new business objectives that can be powered via ML systems adjacent to existing ones at Dropbox.<br><br>* I reduce complex designs and concepts to simple foundational components through correct choices of modeling approach,  applications of algorithms, or other deep insight into the problem space.<br><br>* I am responsible for soundness and validity of the design and strategy of experimentations for my team.<br><br>* I am familiar with infra and frontend components that go together with ML systems and can design robust and effective interfaces between these systems. |
| **Code** **F****luency** | * The expectations for code fluency do not go up beyond L3. |
| **Software** **D****esign** | * I design software components that are difficult to misuse and flexible in the face of an increase in the number of adjacent use cases as appropriate to the direction of the business  (neither under nor over-designed)<br><br>* I reduce complex designs and concepts to simple foundational components through correct choices of data structures, applications of algorithms, or other deep insight into the problem space  (ex:  3 tree model in sync engine) and create simple interfaces to complex underlying systems<br><br>* I’m able to review designs in related areas with high quality and ensure quality for cross-team cross-module design/API issues<br><br>* I may have deep expertise in implementation or principles behind some of the libraries, platforms and systems relevant to my team's work |
| **Architecture Design** | * I make correct technology choices for components needed as part of a larger architecture, including making build vs buy choices for specific components, and choosing frameworks<br><br>* I’m capable of owning the overall health and engineering quality of a system or collection of features - e.g. driving regular health reviews, curating test strategy, etc - and ensuring that the health and maintenance of my systems do not depend on the maintainers having my expertise<br><br>* I’m capable of driving overall testing strategy of a significant system with high reliability or quality requirements  (e.g. building validation systems or new test frameworks to do so)<br><br>* I’m capable of designing systems with significant ambiguity and/or lots of systems that depend on it |
| **Technical Strategy** | * I’m accountable for alignment of the software and systems in my area to overall technical strategy, making tradeoffs where appropriate in consultation with principal engineers |
