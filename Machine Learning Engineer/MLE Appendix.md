# MLE: Appendix

Glossary
========

We’re striving to use clear language, but there are a few words where it’s helpful to expound upon how we interpret them.

Craft Responsibility Definitions
--------------------------------

The responsibilities defined below make up the foundation of the Machine Learning Engineer craft:

*   **ML Fluency:** Ability to select the right ML algorithm, tooling, and technique for ML projects and following through with robust statistical analyses and visualization techniques.

*   **ML Design:** Ability to formulate business objectives to ML tasks; defining quality metrics and experimentation strategy that lead up to the objectives; proficiency in designing for different lifecycle\* stages and interactions thereof in an ML project.

*   **Code fluency:** The ability to read and write code fluently and well.

*   **Software design:** The ability to design software components with reasonable APIs and interaction patterns (writing good classes, modules, etc - building out a box in your architecture diagram)

*   **Architecture design:** The ability to design systems of interacting components - e.g. a collection of interacting features or the architecture of a product, binary or significant service (what are the boxes in your architecture diagram, how do they interact)

*   **Technical strategy:** Ensuring the right long-term technical decisions are being made by the organization - knowing what systems to build; making technical choices when there are not clear solutions. What standards apply to all the boxes in the organizations architecture diagrams?

\* **ML development lifecycle** refers to the stages/tasks in the life of an ML projects: task formulation; dataset collection, cleaning, and aggregation; feature extraction; modeling, optimization, and evaluation; off/on-line testing, deployment and monitoring; and iteration based on feedback from each stage.
