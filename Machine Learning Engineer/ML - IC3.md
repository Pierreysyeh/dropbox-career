------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have achieved proficiency in ML development lifecycle*. I am familiar with applied ML techniques and toolkits.

I have mastered the fundamentals of code fluency. I have a well-rounded set of software design skills that allow me to build correct, maintainable software components.

| **Responsibility** | **Key Behaviors** |
| **ML Fluency** | * I am familiar with a range of ML techniques  (e.g.,  deep learning, optimization, regression, ensembles, tree-based methods, dimensionality reduction, Bayesian modeling, etc.), areas  (CV, NLP, RL, etc.),  and tools  (sklearn, pytorch, tensorflow, etc.) and I select a right such solution for my project.<br><br>* I maintain awareness of the state of the art, and can select an appropriate algorithm, tool or technique for a given problem.<br><br>* I can analyze and present datasets or results of experiments while choosing the appropriate statistical methods and visualization techniques. |
| **ML Design** | * I can translate a business problem into a spec for a  computational task such as classification, ranking, or generation.<br><br>* I am proficient in  ML development lifecycle* and can design each stage according to the needs of the project.<br><br>* I define and track offline and online metrics in service of business objectives.<br><br>* I prepare and conduct experiments, analyze the results, and adapt my strategy to reflect significant  findings. |
| **Code** **F****luency** | * I write code that captures the essential nature of the solution and is appropriately flexible, reusable, efficient, and adaptable to changing requirements.<br><br>* I ensure high code quality in code reviews.<br><br>* I have a strong awareness of the ecosystem of tools and libraries supporting my primary programming language and development environment and a strong grasp of the idioms and patterns of my language. I may be intimately familiar with the open source community surrounding it. |
| **Software** **D****esign** | * I am able to independently design software components in well scoped scenarios, with simplicity and maintenance as key considerations. My components are testable, debuggable and have logical APIs that are not easily misused.<br><br>* I know when to make significant refactors and when it’s better to leave things as-is.<br><br>* I have a strong grasp of the libraries, platforms, and systems that I rely on, allowing me to apply them expertly |

\* **ML development lifecycle** refers to the stages/tasks in the life of an ML projects:  task formulation; dataset collection, cleaning, and aggregation; feature extraction; modeling, optimization, and evaluation; off/on-line testing, deployment and monitoring; and iteration based on feedback from each stage.
