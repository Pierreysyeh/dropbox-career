At this level, I drive testing for small-to-medium sized projects, identify and fix simple quality process issues with assistance as needed from my EM / TL and explain effective testing and quality process principles to developers enabling them to execute testing related activities.

**QA Collaborative Reach at L2**

QA Engineers support one or two teams that are small-to-medium in terms of the number of engineers whose surface areas are relatively straightforward in their complexity.

| --- | --- |
| **Responsibility** | **Key Behaviors** |
| **Testing Fluency** | * My testing is informed by the specs, basic knowledge of the architecture, and reasonable assumptions  (e.g. frontend vs backend changes).<br><br>* I proactively work with subject matter experts to identify test cases that would require domain knowledge  (edge cases related to code architecture, test cases around integration points) to ensure my testing is thorough<br><br>* I have familiarity with several types of testing  (e.g. frontend, backend, automation, usability, or a specific platform)<br><br>* I exhibit good attention to detail and consistently notice bugs that might not be caught by a verification step<br><br>* I provide valuable test case reviews in areas I know well<br><br>* I may be a subject matter expert on testing some part of Dropbox functionality<br><br>* I work with eng DRIs to define and prioritize which test cases can and should be automated<br><br>* My bug reports contain enough detailed information for developers enabling them to quickly identify the root cause making the bugs more actionable |
| **Testing Strategy** | * I work with my Manager and/or TL to identify high risk projects that I will embed within.<br><br>* I  plan and execute testing of small to medium size projects that could span multiple sprints, including estimating  and prioritizing QA tasks<br><br>* I prioritize test coverage based on straightforward criteria  (e.g. happy path vs. not, number of users on a platform, customer impact, etc..) |
| **Quality Process Strategy** | * I understand the established Quality Processes that drive effective quality management and I am learning how changes in their execution can impact quality<br><br>* I identify, surface, and fix simple process/testability issues within the team(s) I am supporting with assistance as needed from EM / TL |
| **Quality Assessment** | * I proactively and clearly report status and quality risks to partners and team for the work that I directly own and I am able to leverage basic quality metrics effectively when doing this. |
| **Quality Advocacy** | * I teach the basic skills of Testing Fluency to cross functional partners; for developers this improves their ability to test their own code.<br><br>* I explain and advocate  (with the support of more senior QAEs) for established quality process that enable effective quality management to stakeholders  (e.g.  PM, EM, TL) and developers.<br><br>* I proactively engage cross functional partners  (e.g. PM ,CX,) to learn more about my customers, and work to resolve  quality challenges they see<br><br>* I use my understanding of the customer to provide clear and compelling arguments for fixing or not fixing various bugs |
