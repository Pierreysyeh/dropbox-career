-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this level,  I am expected to play a key role in setting testing and quality strategy across the teams I support.  I have a deep knowledge of testing specific aspects of Dropbox functionality and possess a wide view of how the Dropbox product’s surface areas fit together. I  am either very skilled and deep in solving one type of problem, or demonstrate versatility across multiple problem types. I  drive and plan testing of large, complex, cross-team projects that could span multiple quarters and often involve multiple QA engineers. I drive process improvements that involve multiple teams simultaneously and may take on quality improvement projects that impact the larger organization.

**QA Collaborative Reach at L4**

An L4 engineer typically takes comprehensive ownership of quality and process issues  across an area or group depending on size.

| --- | --- |
| **Responsibility** | **Key Behaviors** |
| **Testing Fluency** | * I effectively execute on medium to large projects with minimal ramp-up even in an area where I lack domain expertise, via leveraging an understanding of testing principles and appropriately using domain knowledge resources  (e.g. documentation, asking experts)<br><br>* I identifying the likely breakages or risk areas in a feature at the spec or engineering review phase, before the feature has actually been built<br><br>* I identify and explain the root cause of bugs in areas where I have domain expertise<br><br>* I  am likely a subject matter expert on a highly complex testing surface area that has dependencies across organizational boundaries and/or requires deep knowledge of a highly technical surface area<br><br>* I have an understanding of test automation and drive automation strategy to provide guidance on how specific tests should be automated and common automation risks/failures |
| **Testing Strategy** | * I independently identify high risk projects that I should embed in and and what level of support I should give them. On low touch projects my impact is still felt and tangible enabling me to have broad impact<br><br>* I  drive and plan testing of large, complex, cross-team projects that could span multiple quarters and often involve multiple QA engineers<br><br>* I am able to independently drive the creation of a quality bar for complex launch reviews and drive alignment around that bar at the team and area level that appropriately balances customer and business needs  (set for various milestones, defining acceptable behavior at release)<br><br>* I am able to independently drive + get buy-in on a clear and principled set of quality metrics for a project or team<br><br>* I have familiarity with a wide range of testing techniques and can use the appropriate ones at the appropriate times to create a comprehensive testing strategy for a project<br><br>* I provide valuable Test Strategy review without detailed domain knowledge<br><br>* I can rapidly iterate on a test plan or test strategy based on results of prior testing |
| **Quality** **Process** **Strategy** | * I can reliably identify, and effectively address, important process or testability gaps that are not obviously gaps or that the team(s) I am working with may not recognize as problems<br><br>* I prioritize quality process work across an area or across multiple teams not within my immediate lens<br><br>* I identify and put in place both impactful and sustainable quality processes across an area<br><br>* I can reliably create and deploy effective solutions to complex problems that hurt quality in an area<br><br>* I plan ahead to establish the right quality processes + strategy not just for the current project, but also aligned with the overall strategy and future direction of the team  (if applicable) |
| **Quality Assessment** | * I detect quality metric gaps within my supported teams and their dependencies and advise on strategies to address those gaps<br><br>* I notice upfront and compellingly advocate for addressing subtle quality risks  (e.g. dependencies, lack of appropriate expertise in staffing, conflicting team priorities, poor communication between teams) before they become a problem |
| **Quality** **Advocacy** | * I effectively teach and explain advanced Testing Fluency and Advanced Testing Strategy principles to the cross functional members of the development team, enabling them to take on this work for low-medium risk projects with minimal support |
