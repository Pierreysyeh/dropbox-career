At the entry-level for QA Engineers at Dropbox, I am focused on learning the fundamentals of testing fluency, testing strategy, and quality assessment.

| **Responsibility** | **Key Behaviors** |
| **Testing Fluency** | * I write test cases for a feature that is well-defined  (but may not have a formal written spec) and utilizes knowledge of our customers<br><br>* primarily execute manual  “black box” UI testing<br><br>* I  identify bugs that are obvious/clearly present<br><br>* My test cases  effectively cover positive and negative test cases and include most  basic edge cases<br><br>* My bug reports provide sufficient detail _so that a developer can investigate further_. |
| **Testing Strategy** | * I  plan and execute testing on small to medium sized features of simple to moderate complexity. |
| **Quality Assessment** | * I report status to cross-functional partners including a basic understanding of quality risks. |
| **Quality Advocacy** | * I understand who the customers are for the features I work on and the intended impact of the feature on them |
