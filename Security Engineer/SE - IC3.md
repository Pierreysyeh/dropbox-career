| * I own and deliver projects in service of quarterly goals on the team.<br><br>* I define security solutions and can select the best approach within many. I work independently and seek help when necessary.<br><br>* I deliver solutions to ambiguous security problems where the solution may not have been obvious at the outset.<br><br>* I  identify and implement necessary short-term risk reduction measures while designing, building, or securing commitment on longer-term systemic improvements.<br><br>* I demonstrate understanding of how my work aligns with 1-2 year security goals | * I work primarily with my direct team and cross-functional partners while driving cross-team collaboration for my project<br><br>* My scope of influence is primarily within my team, but I can work across teams. I influence process, priorities, and trade-offs.<br><br>* I own and propose solutions for problems even when outside of my specific domain, informing and/or handing off to correct owners when necessary.<br><br>* I regularly and effectively partner with other teams on substantial projects  (new features with difficult security concerns or major internal services) and use that opportunity to build lasting improvements to Dropbox’s security posture across projects.<br><br>* I work with partner teams to create opportunities to improve security on an ongoing basis. | * I continue to master my craft, and effectively choose when to hone and apply a broad array of skills utilized by security engineers to solve a security problem. I have demonstrated an ability to apply several different skills.<br><br>* I define and deliver well-scoped security projects. I may be a technical lead for projects on my team. My work reduces or mitigates risk in a major portion of a product or service.<br><br>* I actively level up less-experienced members of my team by helping them with their craft, providing guidance, and leading by example.<br><br>* I work on large components, applications, security events or security services.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a significant and autonomous contributor. I have mastered the fundamentals of information security and can apply them effectively in novel situations. I solve ambiguous and challenging security problems. I can decompose security problems or incidents into solutions to help mitigate attacks that could compromise large systems, company trust, or customer data. I understand the technologies and techniques used in my area and how they fit together. I focus on projects with cross-functional impact. My work is consistently of high quality. I engage autonomously with product and system owners to help create, build, innovate, and operate security defenses, possibly by writing code, scripts, creating detections, among others.

| **Responsibility** | **Key Behaviors** |
| **Security** **Execution** | * My work demonstrates  deep domain expertise in one or more core security domains and secondary specializations,  (e.g. infrastructure security, application security, threat intelligence, security operations, incident response, endpoint security, or identity management), sufficient to anticipate and communicate the implications of my work on adjacent fields.<br><br>* I perform risk analyses to a degree of rigor  which enables me, my cross-functional partners, and future security engineers to weigh the the strengths and weaknesses of different options, and make recommendations for risk mitigation, acceptance, or escalation.<br><br>* I  design and implement new systems, tools, or processes to enforce security requirements, detect badness, or otherwise defend Dropbox.<br><br>* I select, integrate, and/or improve operational support for technology that my team relies on to enforce security requirements, detect badness, or otherwise defend Dropbox.<br><br>* When I approach a problem I identify the applicable security strategies, weigh the tradeoffs of each, negotiate the best way forward, and effectively influence others to follow that path.<br><br>* I lead others to resolve security issues, to respond to incidents, and to eliminate or mitigate vulnerabilities as they arise.<br><br>* I actively work with partner orgs to drive awareness of policy, standards, best practices, and regulations.<br><br>* I base my decisions on validated evidence/data or I explicitly identify the cases where no data is available and the assumptions I am making instead. |
| **Technology Fluency** | * I have deep understanding of more than one domain  (e.g.  application, OS, networks, or hardware) and can quickly understand complex systems and identify the major security issues with them.<br><br>* I demonstrate and can apply understanding of the technologies Dropbox uses within my area of focus<br><br>* I can navigate through full stacks and build proficiency on the right tools to dig deep into the security issues.<br><br>* I understand that technology, threats, and responses evolve and plan security controls accordingly. |
| **Threat Fluency** | * I am broadly knowledgeable about attacks and attacker mindset. <br><br>* I am broadly aware of the kinds of defenses and their efficacy at mitigating attacks relevant to my team’s focus.<br><br>* I have gained practical experience performing attacks and using attacker tools, and take this into account in my projects or operations work. I continuously seek to learn about and apply lessons learned from new attacks/attackers to my area of focus.<br><br>* I have an understanding of how the tools at my disposal have historically failed, and what those failures indicate about the limitations or risks associated with security mechanisms. |
