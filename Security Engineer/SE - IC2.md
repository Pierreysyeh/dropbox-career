------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am an autonomous contributor. I create and execute security controls, defenses, and countermeasures to detect and mitigate internal and/or external attacks, seeking guidance from my team and lead. My solutions help mitigate attempts to infiltrate company systems  (e.g., services, products, components, email, data, commerce, among others) to protect customer data and trust. I help mitigate attacks that could potentially compromise large systems, company trust, or customer data. I deliver consistently high-quality work.

| **Responsibility** | **Key Behaviors** |
| **Security** **Execution** | * My work demonstrates basic competence as a security practitioner - I apply basic principles such as least privilege and defense in depth appropriately to a set of problems within my team and projects.<br><br>* I assess the security of systems  through code reviews, penetration tests, intuitive reasoning  (with or without the application of a security framework), or manual testing  (using  ethical hacking tools or custom-written tools where they don’t yet exist.<br><br>* I develop, test, review, debug,  and/or deploy code to enforce security requirements, detect badness to meet security objectives.<br><br>* I deploy, manage, monitor, and/or provide sustainable operational support for technology that my team relies on to enforce security requirements, detect badness to meet security objectives.<br><br>* I understand the designs and technology choices within my focus area and make technically-sound adjustments based on feedback, changes in the environment, and/or evolving threats.<br><br>* I help resolve security issues, respond to incidents, and eliminate or mitigate vulnerabilities as they arise.<br><br>* I provide clearly articulated and reasoned security guidance in areas I know well, both inside and outside of security team. |
| **Technology Fluency** | * I  am familiar with relevant external and Dropbox-specific technologies within my domain, and am working to develop a deeper understanding.<br><br>* I seek to learn the business context and technologies behind my team’s security services and the segment of the business I focus on. |
| **Threat Fluency** | * I understand attackers and their tools, techniques, and goals. I am able to learn  from historical examples.<br><br>* I understand how defenses  address and mitigate common vulnerabilities made use of by malicious code, and how attackers bypass or negate common defensive techniques<br><br>* I have an understanding of strengths and weaknesses of the tools at my disposal to diffuse the impact and disrupt or detect attackers taking advantage of potential systems’ vulnerabilities. |
