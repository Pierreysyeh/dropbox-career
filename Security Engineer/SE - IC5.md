| * I deliver multi-year, multi-team security goals.<br><br>* I work in areas where the security strategy is not defined. I may not know the security problem before starting.<br><br>* I own complex issues, and decompose them into simple, scalable solutions and work products. I am able to explain and teach this skill.<br><br>* I exhibit a very high standard of technical judgement, innovation and execution to tackle open-ended problems that require difficult prioritization, defining both the what and how of things to be done. | * I exercise judgment that favors the priorities of the wider security org rather than favoring locally optimal outcomes.<br><br>* I Influence the business and technology direction. I align teams and orgs towards simple, coherent security goals. | * I demonstrate a high level of depth in a particular platform or product category that brings unique business value. <br><br>* I excel at defining the vision for and delivering large business-impacting projects with multiple constraints.<br><br>* I increasingly influence product decisions/scope and determine the right technical tradeoffs to deliver customer value quickly.<br><br>* I lead by example, I serve as a role model for other Dropbox security engineers, and teach all aspects of Security Craft.<br><br>* I deliver with complete independence.<br><br>* I work on significantly large or endemic security problems and projects.<br><br>* I adapt to fill both technical and organizational gaps across the security organization, sometimes assuming roles that are not clearly scoped as Security Engineering or IC.<br><br>* I use my expertise to affect system security and how the organization operates, partnering with TLs and leads to drive the organization towards higher degrees of maturity, effectiveness, and excellence. |

| **Impact** | * I identify and execute on opportunities that have area/group-wide impact <br><br>* I execute large projects to a very high standard — e.g. against a tight deadline with significant consequences of failure, or in a manner that allows rapid learning to clarify significant ambiguity, or to a standard of quality well exceeding that of the current system  (though not all simultaneously)<br><br>* I know which levers to pull to drive meaningful results and understand the wider, cross-functional implications of my work. I proactively account for risks and monitor their likelihood. My project planning accounts for new capabilities necessary to deliver large-scale business impact and I work closely with partner teams to prioritize the development of these capabilities.<br><br>* I proactively identify and help to refocus my team's efforts when projects are off-course or not technically feasible and results aren’t moving the needle for our business/team goals or serving the needs of customers in a meaningful way |
| **Ownership** | * I have a sense of responsibility and obligation to act on opportunities I see across the engineering org/company |
| **Decision Making** | * I have a holistic view of the engineering org and Dropbox’s goals and use  my experience and judgment to make decisions optimized for the wider org, rather than my local project alone<br><br>* I act thoughtfully and decisively in critical situations even when making challenging or unpopular decisions<br><br>* I'm able to reach the right  decision despite conflicting perspectives |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a trusted part of the technical leadership of the security organization. I have the versatility to take on a wide variety of projects, incidents, and roles characterized by high complexity, broad scope, and high impact. I am a crucial influencer in the security strategy. I bring business, technical, and industry context to security solutions. I am a hands-on technical leader. I identify endemic security problems, define technologies, and architectures to mitigate them. I set the standard for excellence in the security organization and mitigate security risks and threats with innovative concepts. I mentor emerging leaders and consistently role model the leadership behaviors that are expected. My solutions are robust, resistant to erosion, and secure by default. I work with cross-functional partners to discover novel solutions to business problems.

| **Responsibility** | **Key Behaviors** |
| **Security** **Execution** | * My work demonstrates broad and deep security domain expertise, and I successfully apply it across technology domains  (e.g. software, networking, risk management, operating systems, etc) to realize cross-functional security objectives and drive the maturity of the security team overall.<br><br>* I independently and proactively identify areas of security risk and future needs, reach out to the relevant teams, collaboratively design solutions to that risk, and successfully implement them in a sustainable way that  “permanently” reduces risk across entire classes of threats.<br><br>* I design, deliver, and drive solutions for significantly complex security and risk problems across dropbox organizations.<br><br>* I split my time in different areas such as, security solution design, and/or security architecture, based on where my skills have the greatest impact  (or in response to a security problem).<br><br>* I deliver solutions that are resistant to erosion of security controls over time and integrate ongoing testing strategies as part of the foundational design<br><br>* I own the response to extraordinary or otherwise sensitive security incidents.<br><br>* I adapt my role to the needs of an initiative, the security team, or a cross-functional partner team over time.<br><br>* I understand that technology, threats, and responses evolve, and drive that evolution to create opportunity to improve security across Dropbox.<br><br>* I motivate security controls that simplify, optimize, and prevent bottlenecks. |
| **Technology Fluency** | The expectations for technology fluency do not go up beyond L4  (though some specialist engineers may go deep in one or more areas) |
| **Threat Fluency** | * I have a deep understanding of attacker tools, techniques, and processes  (TTPs) and an extensive array of defenses/mitigations for them.<br><br>* I am deeply aware of the kinds of defenses and their efficacy at mitigating attacks relevant to Dropbox Security. |
